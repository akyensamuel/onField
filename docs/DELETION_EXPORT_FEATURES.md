# Deletion & Export Features - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of deletion audit logging and data export functionality for the OnField Recording System.

---

## 1. ‚úÖ Deletion Audit Log System

### New Model: `DeletionLog`

**Location:** `DataForm/models.py`

**Purpose:** Track all deletions of operations and records for compliance and audit purposes.

**Fields:**
```python
class DeletionLog(models.Model):
    deleted_by = ForeignKey(User)           # Who deleted it
    item_type = CharField                    # 'operation' or 'record'
    item_id = IntegerField                   # ID of deleted item
    item_name = CharField                    # Name/number of deleted item
    deletion_reason = TextField              # Why it was deleted
    deleted_at = DateTimeField               # When it was deleted
    metadata = JSONField                     # Additional context (JSON)
```

**Metadata Examples:**

For Operations:
```json
{
    "operation_name": "Summer Campaign 2025",
    "record_count": 150,
    "was_active": true,
    "created_by": "admin",
    "created_at": "2025-10-01T10:30:00",
    "next_record_seq": 151
}
```

For Records:
```json
{
    "record_number": "OP001-00042",
    "operation": "Summer Campaign 2025",
    "customer_name": "John Doe",
    "account_number": "ACC-12345",
    "meter_number": "MTR-67890",
    "status": "submitted",
    "type_of_anomaly": "broken_meter",
    "media_count": 3,
    "created_by": "staff_user",
    "created_at": "2025-10-15T14:20:00"
}
```

###Admin Interface

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Read-only (cannot be manually created/edited)
- ‚úÖ Searchable by item name, reason, user
- ‚úÖ Filterable by item type, date, user
- ‚úÖ JSON metadata displayed in formatted view
- ‚úÖ Only superusers can delete logs (retention policy)

**Access:** Admin Panel ‚Üí Deletion Logs

---

## 2. ‚úÖ Operation Deletion with Logging

### What Changed

**Before:**
- ‚ùå Could not delete operations with records
- ‚ùå No audit trail of deletions
- ‚ùå Simple confirmation dialog

**After:**
- ‚úÖ Can delete operations even with records (cascading delete)
- ‚úÖ Full audit logging with metadata
- ‚úÖ Required deletion reason (logged)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced confirmation modal

### Implementation

**View Function:** `operation_delete` (`DataForm/views.py`)

**Logic Flow:**
1. Admin clicks "Delete" button on operation detail page
2. Modal appears requiring deletion reason
3. User enters reason and confirms
4. System logs deletion details to `DeletionLog`
5. Operation and all related records are deleted (cascade)
6. Success message shows count of deleted records
7. Redirect to operation list

**Permissions:**
- Admin only (`@admin_required` decorator)

**Code Example:**
```python
@admin_required
def operation_delete(request, pk):
    operation = get_object_or_404(Operation, pk=pk)
    
    if request.method == 'POST':
        deletion_reason = request.POST.get('deletion_reason', '').strip()
        record_count = Record.objects.filter(operation=operation).count()
        
        # Log before deleting
        DeletionLog.objects.create(
            deleted_by=request.user,
            item_type='operation',
            item_id=operation.pk,
            item_name=operation.name,
            deletion_reason=deletion_reason or 'No reason provided',
            metadata={...}  # Collect operation metadata
        )
        
        # Delete (cascades to records and media)
        operation.delete()
        
        messages.success(request, f'Operation "{operation.name}" and its {record_count} record(s) deleted.')
        return redirect('operation_list')
```

### UI Enhancement

**Deletion Modal Features:**
- Required reason textarea
- Character count/validation
- Record count warning
- Dark mode support
- Auto-focus on reason field
- Form validation (prevents submission without reason)

**Template:** `operation_detail.html`

---

## 3. ‚úÖ Record Deletion with Logging

### What's New

- ‚úÖ Delete button added to record detail page
- ‚úÖ Permission check (admin OR record creator)
- ‚úÖ Full audit logging
- ‚úÖ Deletion reason required
- ‚úÖ Cascade delete media files

### Implementation

**View Function:** `record_delete` (`DataForm/views.py`)

**Permissions:**
- Admin users (can delete any record)
- Record creator (can delete own records)

**Logic Flow:**
1. User clicks "Delete" on record detail page
2. Permission check (admin or creator)
3. Modal appears requiring deletion reason
4. User enters reason and confirms
5. System logs deletion to `DeletionLog` with metadata
6. Record and related media files deleted
7. Redirect to record list

**Code Example:**
```python
@login_required
def record_delete(request, pk):
    record = get_object_or_404(Record, pk=pk)
    
    # Permission check
    if not (request.user.profile.role == 'admin' or record.created_by == request.user):
        messages.error(request, 'Permission denied.')
        return redirect('record_detail', pk=pk)
    
    if request.method == 'POST':
        deletion_reason = request.POST.get('deletion_reason', '').strip()
        media_count = RecordMedia.objects.filter(record=record).count()
        
        # Log before deleting
        DeletionLog.objects.create(
            deleted_by=request.user,
            item_type='record',
            item_id=record.pk,
            item_name=record.record_number,
            deletion_reason=deletion_reason,
            metadata={...}  # Collect record metadata
        )
        
        # Delete (cascades to media files)
        record.delete()
        
        messages.success(request, f'Record {record.record_number} deleted.')
        return redirect('record_list')
```

**URL Route:** `records/<int:pk>/delete/`

**Template:** `record_detail.html` (includes delete modal)

---

## 4. üîÑ PDF Export for Operations (In Progress)

### Planned Features

**Export Details:**
- Operation summary (name, dates, status, creator)
- Statistics (total records, by status, anomalies)
- Records table (paginated if many records)
- Charts/graphs (optional - anomaly distribution)
- Generated date and user info

**Implementation Plan:**
```python
@admin_required
def operation_export_pdf(request, pk):
    operation = get_object_or_404(Operation, pk=pk)
    records = Record.objects.filter(operation=operation)
    
    # Create PDF using ReportLab
    response = HttpResponse(content_type='application/pdf')
    response['Content-Disposition'] = f'attachment; filename="operation_{operation.pk}.pdf"'
    
    # Generate PDF content
    ...
    
    return response
```

**Button Location:** Operation detail page (top right, next to delete button)

---

## 5. üîÑ XLSX Export for Operations (Planned)

### Planned Features

**Excel Workbook Structure:**

**Sheet 1: Summary**
- Operation name, description
- Date range, duration
- Creator, status
- Total records by status
- Anomaly breakdown

**Sheet 2: Records Data**
- All record fields in columns
- One record per row
- Formatted headers
- Conditional formatting for status
- Formulas for totals

**Implementation Plan:**
```python
@admin_required
def operation_export_xlsx(request, pk):
    operation = get_object_or_404(Operation, pk=pk)
    records = Record.objects.filter(operation=operation)
    
    # Create workbook using openpyxl
    wb = Workbook()
    
    # Summary sheet
    ws1 = wb.active
    ws1.title = "Summary"
    ...
    
    # Records data sheet
    ws2 = wb.create_sheet("Records")
    ...
    
    response = HttpResponse(
        content_type='application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet'
    )
    response['Content-Disposition'] = f'attachment; filename="operation_{operation.pk}.xlsx"'
    wb.save(response)
    
    return response
```

**Button Location:** Operation detail page (next to PDF export button)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. No undo for deletions (by design - audit log serves as record)
2. No bulk operations yet
3. Export limited to PDF/XLSX (CSV coming)
4. No file size limits on exports (could be large for many records)

### Performance Considerations
1. Large operations (1000+ records) may take time to delete
2. PDF generation for 100+ records may be slow
3. Excel files with 1000+ rows may be large

### Recommendations
1. Archive old operations instead of deleting when possible
2. Export in batches for very large datasets
3. Regular cleanup of deletion logs (retention policy)
