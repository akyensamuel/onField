## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. **Server is Already Running!**
Your development server should be running at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

### 2. **Admin Access**
- URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`
- Username: `admin`
- Password: (your superuser password)

### 3. **Create Users via Admin Panel**

**To create a Staff user:**
1. Go to Admin Panel → Users → Add User
2. Set username and password
3. In the inline "User Profile" section:
   - Set Role: **Staff**
   - Enter Employee ID (e.g., EMP-002)
   - Enter Phone Number
4. Save

**To create an Admin user:**
1. Same as above, but set Role: **Admin**
2. Admin users can manage operations

### 4. **Test Workflow**

#### As Admin:
1. Login at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/`
2. Go to **Operations** → **Create New Operation**
3. Enter operation name (e.g., "Q1 2025 Meter Reading")
4. Add description
5. Check "Set as Active Operation"
6. Click **Create Operation**

#### As Staff:
1. Login with staff credentials
2. Dashboard shows active operation
3. Click **New Record** button
4. Fill in all required fields:
   - Customer Name
   - Customer Contact (07XXXXXXXX format)
   - Account Number
   - Click **"Capture Current Location"** for GPS
   - Enter meter details
   - (Optional) Select anomaly type and add remarks
5. Upload photos (drag & drop or click)
6. Click **Submit Record** (or **Save as Draft**)

#### Testing Features:
- ✅ View records: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/records/`
- ✅ Search/filter records
- ✅ View record details with photos and GPS map link
- ✅ View operation details with stats
- ✅ Close/Activate operations (admin only)
- ✅ View audit trails (admin only in record details)

## 📝 Management Commands

### Generate Test Data (Optional)
```cmd
python manage.py generate_test_data --clear
```

Creates:
- 2 staff users: `staff1`, `staff2` (password: `testpass123`)
- 1 admin user: `testadmin` (password: `testpass123`)
- 3 operations (2 closed, 1 active)
- 30-50 sample records with realistic data

**Note:** If you get conflicts with existing data, you can:
1. Skip this step and manually create users via admin panel
2. Or use the `--clear` flag (it will try to delete test data first)

---

## 🎨 UI Features

### Navigation
- Logo and app name (top left)
- User dropdown menu (top right) with:
  - Change Password
  - Logout
- Mobile hamburger menu (responsive)
- Active operation indicator in nav bar

### Dashboard Cards
- **Total Records**: Shows count with icon
- **Draft Records**: Gray badge
- **Submitted Records**: Blue badge (primary)
- **Verified Records**: Green badge

### Badges & Indicators
- **Active Operation**: Green badge with pulsing dot
- **Closed Operation**: Gray badge
- **Anomaly**: Yellow/Warning badge
- **Status**: Color-coded (draft=gray, submitted=blue, verified=green)

### Forms
- Floating labels
- Inline validation
- Error messages with icons

## 🔐 User Roles & Permissions

| Feature | Staff | Admin |
|---------|-------|-------|
| View Dashboard | ✅ | ✅ |
| View Records | ✅ (own records) | ✅ (all records) |
| Create Records | ✅ (if active op exists) | ✅ |
| Edit Records | ✅ (own records, if op active) | ✅ (any record) |
| Create Operations | ❌ | ✅ |
| Activate/Close Operations | ❌ | ✅ |
| View Audit Logs | ❌ | ✅ |
| Export to Excel | ❌ | ✅ |
| Admin Panel Access | ❌ | ✅ |

## 📊 Record Number Format

Records are auto-numbered using the format:
```
JOB-{operation_id:03d}-{sequence:04d}
```

Examples:
- `JOB-001-0001` (First record in operation 1)
- `JOB-001-0002` (Second record in operation 1)
- `JOB-002-0001` (First record in operation 2)

**Thread-safe:** Uses `select_for_update()` to prevent race conditions when multiple staff create records simultaneously.

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Excel Export**: Button present but backend not implemented (uses pandas/openpyxl)
2. **OCR Processing**: RecordMedia has OCR fields but processing not implemented
3. **Celery Tasks**: Installed but not configured for async processing
4. **Reverse Geocoding**: GPS capture fills address field with coordinates; external API needed for actual addresses
5. **Test Data Command**: May conflict with existing records - use admin panel to create test users instead
